# Comparatory app
[Comparatory.io](https://www.comparatory.io/) is a Flask web application that explores high-dimensional representations of public companies learned from 10K documents using an algorithm called _paragraph vectors_. A brief blog post describing these learned representations can be found [here](https://eightportions.com/2017-02-12-Company-vectors/).
