	Using deep-learning models, ***REMOVED*** learns to understand a company's core business. It represents this abstract understanding in a dense vector (i.e., a series of numbers). These dense vectors are boiled down into two dimensions, one horizontal and one vertical, for easier visual consumption by humans. This process is called <i>dimensionality reduction</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
	You may notice that some of the companies ***REMOVED*** thinks are the most comparable to the company you entered are not necessarily the closest companies on the scatter plot â€” this is the result of the dimensionality reduction process described above. An unavoidable consequence of dimensionality reduction is that some information is lost along the way. On average, the information that is discarded is less relevant than what is kept; however, some of the discarded information might be more relevant to some companies than to others. In these cases, the nearest neighbors in the scatter plot may not align with the top five most similar companies identified by ***REMOVED***.
	</p>

	<p>
	The top five most similar companies incorporate all relevant information, while the scatter plot is a simplified representation of the complete, underlying information. As a result, these top five are expected to be more accurate than the nearest neighbors in the scatter plot.
